# DrawingRecognition_For_DS_Children_ML_Model
This model is designed to support children with Down syndrome by helping them learn and practice drawing through an AI-powered recognition system. The primary goal of the model is to identify simple drawings—such as shapes, fruits, animals, or basic objects—and provide gentle feedback to encourage learning in a fun and interactive way.
